**"I had high expectations for Bella’s Bistro, but unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience from start to finish. The service was painfully slow, even though the restaurant was only half-full. We waited nearly 30 minutes just for someone to take our order, and another 40 minutes for our food to arrive.

When the dishes finally came, they were lukewarm at best. The pasta was overcooked and bland, with barely any seasoning, and the steak was tough and unevenly cooked. We asked for some salt and pepper, but the waiter never came back with them. To make matters worse, the prices were shockingly high for the quality of the food we received.

The ambiance was also a letdown, as the music was too loud, making it hard to have a conversation. Overall, Bella’s Bistro was an unpleasant experience that I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. There are plenty of other places in town that offer much better food, service, and value for the money."**
